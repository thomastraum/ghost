**User Guide**

*Main App*

'f' for fullscreen
'd' switches on debug view where you see the kinect and the skeletons
'k' kills all particles
'q' adds particles
'1','2','3','4' to page through different interface controls

Interface controls, best to change these while having debug mode activated (key d):

Never enable 'autosave', just press save when you are happy with a setting.  

Press '1' to get to the most important settings. 
Change 'Box Depth' to adapt the back wall to the transat space
Adjust 'User offset Y' to make the skeletong be lower or higher placed in the scene.
Tweak "User offset Z" to control someones position in the z space. I use these setting to make sure that the skeleton just disappears in the fog when the user enters the stage. 

The other settings when hitting the numbers 2,3,4,5 are less important. Behind key 2 you have different particle settings, slider "node min" and "node max" inside the "collided" column could be something to be played with as it allows to control the size of the particles which form around the users body.

Generally while the app is running it might be a good idea to kill all particles pressing 'd' and add some new particles via 'q' every now and again. The app automatically limits the amount of particles.

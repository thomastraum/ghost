**priorities**

Camera movement
> move in and out to preset positions
> FOV of cam 

Set it up in the space
> weird particle blob in the center > gldepthtest

Work look of particles and scene
> Test if the stage needs to be bigger
> 

Rigid body collision
> create big demo collider particle
>> test collision and collision events
>>> Repel
>>> change color

Add kinect tracking
> new addon get events

Particle design
> maybe have trail particles?

3D fluid

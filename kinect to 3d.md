**kinect to 3d**

I want to transform the center point of the skeleton into my world:

user.getCenter();

scale this value to my app proportions which are:
leftmost  = -width/2
rightmost = width/2
center		= 0
back			= -width
front			= 0

in the kinect these are:

front = 967.228;
back 	=  

right = -950.871
left	= 950.871
